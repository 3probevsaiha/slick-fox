# Atomic and Nuclear Physics by S.N. Ghoshal: A Book Review
 
Atomic and nuclear physics is a branch of physics that deals with the structure and behavior of atoms and their nuclei. It covers topics such as nuclear models, radioactivity, nuclear reactions, nuclear fission and fusion, elementary particles and cosmic rays. Atomic and nuclear physics is important for understanding the origin and evolution of matter, energy and stars, as well as for applications in medicine, industry and defense.

One of the books that introduces the principles and concepts of atomic and nuclear physics in a simple and easy-to-understand language is *Atomic and Nuclear Physics* by S.N. Ghoshal. The book was first published in 1969 and has been revised and updated several times since then. The latest edition was published in 2008 by S. Chand Publishing[^1^]. The book has 1055 pages and consists of 19 chapters and 10 appendices.
 
The book discusses the structure and properties of atomic nucleus, radioactivity, nuclear radiations, nuclear models, nuclear reactions and accelerators of charged particles. It also discusses nuclear forces and two-body problem, elementary particles and cosmic rays. The book provides numerous examples, problems, diagrams and tables to illustrate the concepts and theories. The book also includes some historical aspects of atomic and nuclear physics, such as the discovery of nucleus, neutron, fission and fusion.
 
The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of physics who want to learn the basics of atomic and nuclear physics. It can also be used as a reference book for teachers and researchers in this field. The book is written in a clear and concise style, with mathematical derivations kept to a minimum. The book assumes that the reader has some knowledge of classical mechanics, electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.
 
*Atomic and Nuclear Physics* by S.N. Ghoshal is a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the fascinating world of atoms and nuclei. It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the fundamental aspects of nature.

Atomic and nuclear physics has a wide range of applications in today's world. Some of its major areas of contributions include:
 
- **Carbon dating** of the specimen in Archeology and Geology. This technique is based on the radioactive decay of carbon-14, which is present in all living organisms. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 left in a sample, one can estimate its age[^4^].
- **Nuclear medicine** for usability in drug administration and radiation therapy. Nuclear medicine uses radioactive isotopes to diagnose and treat various diseases, such as cancer, thyroid disorders and blood disorders. Radioactive isotopes can be injected, swallowed or inhaled by the patient, and then detected by special devices that measure their radiation. Radiation therapy involves the application of ionizing radiation to destroy abnormal cells or tumors[^2^].
- **In the generation of usable energy**. Nuclear energy is produced by nuclear fission or fusion reactions, which release large amounts of energy from small amounts of matter. Nuclear fission is the splitting of heavy nuclei into lighter ones, while nuclear fusion is the joining of light nuclei into heavier ones. Nuclear fission is used in nuclear power plants to generate electricity, while nuclear fusion is still an experimental and challenging technology that aims to mimic the energy source of the sun[^2^].
- **Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion**. Nuclear fission is the splitting of heavy nuclei into lighter ones, while nuclear fusion is the joining of light nuclei into heavier ones. Nuclear fission is used in nuclear power plants to generate electricity, while nuclear fusion is still an experimental and challenging technology that aims to mimic the energy source of the sun[^2^].
- **Nuclear weapons**. Nuclear weapons are devices that use nuclear fission or fusion reactions to create massive explosions. The first nuclear weapon was detonated in 1945 by the United States during World War II, and since then several countries have developed and tested their own nuclear arsenals. Nuclear weapons pose a serious threat to global security and peace, as well as to the environment and human health[^2^].

These are some of the examples of how atomic and nuclear physics has influenced our society and civilization. Atomic and nuclear physics is a fascinating and dynamic field that continues to explore the mysteries of matter and energy at the smallest scales.
